Page 1 - The Glass City
In the heart of the continent stood the Glass City, a marvel of shimmering towers that caught the sunlight like a thousand mirrors. Each morning, as the first light broke over the horizon, the buildings would ignite in a blaze of color—rose, gold, and pale blue. Merchants filled the square, their voices a symphony of trade and promise. Children chased doves between the fountain steps, while the city guard kept quiet watch beneath silver banners. Among the crowd moved Mara Venn, an archivist for the Council of Records. Her task was simple: to collect stories, to preserve the past before it slipped into rumor. But today, her steps were uncertain. Word had come that an entire quarter of the city’s archive had vanished—its shelves bare, its records gone as if they had never been written. The air felt charged, and the whisper of paper missing from history was enough to set her heart racing. Somewhere in those lost pages, she believed, lay the truth about her mother’s disappearance twenty years ago.
