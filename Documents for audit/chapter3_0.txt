Page 3 - The Vault Beneath
The stairwell spiraled deep beneath the city, colder with each step. The walls were etched with names—archivists of centuries past, each sworn to protect the truth. At the bottom, a single iron door waited. Its surface pulsed faintly with blue light. Mara reached out, her fingertips trembling as the metal responded to her touch. The lock clicked. Inside lay a chamber lined with mirrors, each one reflecting not her image but a different scene from history: wars, coronations, discoveries. One mirror stood shattered, its fragments dark and lifeless. From the shards came a whisper, familiar and haunting. “Mara,” it breathed. Her mother’s voice. Leron stepped back, eyes wide. “It’s impossible…” Mara leaned closer, the air crackling with memory. “The archives weren’t stolen,” she said. “They were rewritten.” The word hung in the silence like a curse. Somewhere above them, the city bells began to ring—a warning that history itself was changing.
