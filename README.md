### Total Sales 

The analysis of total sales by product for the first two quarters of 2025 shows that the **MacBook Air**, **iPhone 15**, and **Google Pixel 8** generated the highest revenue, together accounting for a significant share of overall sales. In contrast, **accessories** and lower-priced items such as the **Kindle Paperwhite** and **AirPods** contributed less to total revenue. These trends suggest **strong customer demand** for **premium devices**, indicating that Play Hub should prioritise stocking high-value tech products and maintaining healthy inventory levels for top-performing models. For the remainder of 2025, focusing on replenishing fast-moving, high-margin items while monitoring emerging trends in gaming consoles and accessories could help optimise **sales** and **warehouse efficiency.**

### Total Orders by Month 

The monthly order analysis for the first half of **2025** shows steady growth from **January** to **March**, peaking sharply in **April** with nearly **2,000 orders**, before declining through **May** and **June**. This spike may indicate a seasonal promotion, new product launch, or increased marketing activity driving sales in April. The downward trend in subsequent months suggests potential overstocking risks or reduced customer engagement post-peak. To prepare for the second half of 2025, **Play Hub** should plan inventory and marketing strategies around similar **high-demand periods** while investigating the causes behind the mid-year decline to stabilise future order volumes.

### Total Order by City 

The data shows that **Manchester** led total orders in the first half of the year **(27%)**, followed by **London (21%)** and **Glasgow (17%)**, while other regions collectively made up **35%**. This distribution highlights consistent demand in major cities with strong growth potential across smaller markets. The chart visually emphasises Manchester’s dominant share, with a noticeably larger segment compared to **London** and **Glasgow**, reflecting its role as a key sales hub. The substantial “Other” category slice indicates a wide geographic spread of smaller but collectively significant markets, suggesting opportunities for expansion beyond the main urban centers.

## Recommendations 

• **Inventory Management:**  
Prioritise stocking high-performing products such as the **MacBook Air**, **iPhone 15**, and **Google Pixel 8**, which generated the highest revenue in the first half of **2025**. Maintain strong inventory levels for these items while reassessing storage for slower-moving categories like accessories to reduce holding costs. Looking ahead, warehouse stocking should also prioritise maintaining sufficient inventory for Manchester and London, while expanding product availability in high-performing smaller regions to meet local demand.

• **Promotional Strategy:**  
The sharp rise in orders during **April** suggests a successful campaign or seasonal trend. Play Hub should investigate the drivers behind this surge, such as marketing activities or new releases, and replicate similar efforts in upcoming quarters. Consider offering bundle deals or seasonal promotions aligned with customer buying trends to boost mid-year sales and optimise stock turnover.

• **Sales Performance Deep Dive:**  
Conduct deeper analysis into purchasing patterns, such as peak order months and popular product categories, to refine forecasting and promotional timing. Examining platform performance **(website vs. mobile app)** and marketing channel effectiveness can also help identify where conversion rates are strongest, enabling smarter budget allocation and improved customer engagement.

• **Forecasting and Planning:**  
Use insights from the first two quarters to build demand forecasts for **Q3** and **Q4**. This data-driven approach will help optimise stock levels, anticipate seasonal peaks, and ensure warehouse operations are aligned with customer demand, supporting sustained revenue growth and operational efficiency.

Looking ahead, warehouse stocking should prioritize maintaining sufficient inventory for **Manchester** and **London** while expanding product availability in high-performing smaller regions. A deeper analysis of purchasing patterns during peak order months can guide inventory planning and promotional strategies. Consider offering bundle deals or seasonal promotions aligned with buying trends to boost mid-year sales and optimise stock turnover.
