***Q1,Q2‑Review: Game Shop Sales Report Jan-Jun 2025***

Play Hub is an online retailer specialising in gaming consoles and IT equipment, offering products such as PlayStation 5 consoles, AirPods, and Google Pixel devices. This analysis focused on sales performance for the first half of 2025, using Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Excel to uncover purchasing trends and operational insights. Based on these findings, projections were developed for the second half of the year to guide stock planning, marketing strategies, and revenue optimisation. The review demonstrates how data-driven insights can support stronger business performance.



The review will look at anhnsfhnd provide recommdations the following key areas:

• **Marketing Channel Performance & Revenue Contribution:** .  
• **High- vs Low-Value Single-Order Users:** .  
• **Total Order by City:** An analysis of current stock levels and reorder efficiency.

### Marketing Channel Performance & Revenue Contribution

We looked at revenue performance by each marketing channel, Affiliate, Direct, Email, Search and Social. Revenue is very evenly spread across channels, with Affiliate and Search slightly outperforming the rest.
Search stands out for having the highest average order value, suggesting high-intent customers, while Social and Affiliate drive revenue more through volume.
There’s an opportunity to optimise channel mix rather than relying on any single channel.

### Key Findings

•	**Revenue distribution is balanced** across all channels, with Affiliate (£632k) and Search (£597k) marginally outperforming others.  
•	**Search delivers the highest Average Order Value (£481)**, indicating stronger purchase intent and higher quality traffic.  
•	**Affiliate and Social drive revenue primarily through order volume**, not transaction value.  
•	**Email and Direct perform efficiently but at smaller scale**, with competitive AOVs but lower total orders.   

No channel is currently a clear outlier, suggesting stability but limited upside without targeted optimisation.
 
### Commercial Interpretation  

•	**Intent differentiation:** Search captures late-funnel demand, resulting in higher AOV, while Social and Affiliate capture broader, earlier funnel traffic.  
•	**Volume vs value dynamics:** Revenue parity across channels is achieved through different mechanics. Either higher AOV (Search) or higher order counts (Affiliate, Social).  
•	**Risk profile:** Even revenue spread reduces exposure to channel specific volatility but may indicate under-leveraged high-intent channels.
 
### Strategic Implications & Recommendations  

***Scale selectively***  
•	**Search:** Prioritise incremental investment while closely tracking marginal ROI and cost inflation.  
•	**Affiliate:** Maintain investment given strong revenue contribution, subject to margin and commission control.  

***Optimise before scaling***  
•	**Social:** Focus on conversion rate and AOV uplift through targeting and creative optimisation rather than increased spend.  
•	**Email:** Test segmentation, retention, and cross-sell strategies to unlock incremental revenue from an efficient channel.  

***Manage trade-offs***  
•	**Search** scaling risks diminishing returns as competition increases.  
•	**Affiliate** growth may pressure margins if incentives rise.  
 
***Next Analytical Steps***  
•	Analyse cost per acquisition and ROAS by channel to validate scaling decisions.  
•	Segment performance by customer type (new vs returning) to refine spend allocation.  
•	Test AOV uplift initiatives in lower value channels to improve revenue efficiency.
